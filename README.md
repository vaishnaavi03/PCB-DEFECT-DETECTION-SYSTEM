# PCB DEFECT DETECTION SYSTEM
What it Does:

PCB Vision is an automated quality control system that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to detect manufacturing defects in printed circuit boards. The system analyzes high-resolution images of PCBs, identifying six critical defect types—including short circuits, open circuits, mouse bites, and spurious copper—with 99.1% accuracy. It processes each board in under 3 seconds, generates detailed inspection reports, and provides real-time quality analytics through an intuitive web dashboard.

Who It's For:

This solution is designed for electronics manufacturers, PCB fabrication facilities, and quality assurance teams across the electronics industry. It serves both large-scale production facilities seeking to automate their quality control processes and small to medium manufacturers looking for cost-effective alternatives to expensive commercial AOI systems. Quality managers, production engineers, and manufacturing operations directors will benefit from its consistent inspection capabilities, reduced labor costs, and comprehensive defect documentation.
